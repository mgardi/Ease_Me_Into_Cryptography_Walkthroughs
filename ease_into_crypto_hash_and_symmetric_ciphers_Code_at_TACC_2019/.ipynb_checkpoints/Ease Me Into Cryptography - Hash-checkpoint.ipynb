    "\n",
    "The word \"cryptography\" comes from a combination of the Ancient Greek words kryptós for “hidden or secret” and graphein which is “to write”. At its most basic it is the ability to send and receive a private message. The *key* is that you want your recipient and only your recipient to be able to read the message. Therefore, in most cases cryptography is a 2-way street in hiding AND unhiding a communicated message.\n"

    "A great place to jump in to understanding cryptographic fundamentals is to start with hash functions. What is a hash function? How is it useful? Are there weaknesses? Let’s take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a hash function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function is a non-reversible process for taking any length of input and spitting out a fixed-length value. In other words, it will scramble anything you give it in such a way that you cannot easily retrieve the un-scrambled version. A hash function unlike **cryptographic algorthims** is meant to work *one-way* so we can scramble the message but not get the message back. The output of a hash function is called a digest, but you’ll commonly see it referred to simply as the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cryptographic Algorithm** *is just a fancy term for jibberish instructions. It’s what we call the ruleset that is used to take data from one state to another and (most of the time) back.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of hash functions but one of the most commonly used is SHA256, a version of the Secure Hashing Algorithm that gives a 256-bit (32 bytes) hash. It will give an output that is 32 bytes no matter the length of the input we give it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### We will see how this works by coding our own version so lets get started!\n",
    "### But, also, let's not make it too hard...\n",
    "In these walk throughs we will use the hash functions and **Cryptographic Algorithms** implemented in the Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto). Pycrypto is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, XOR, etc.). Mostly it means we don't have to code the hard stuff from scratch. "
