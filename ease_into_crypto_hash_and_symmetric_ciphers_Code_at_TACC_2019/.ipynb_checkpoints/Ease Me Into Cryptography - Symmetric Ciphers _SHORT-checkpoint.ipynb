    "The word \"cryptography\" comes from a combination of the Ancient Greek words kryptós for “hidden or secret” and graphein which is “to write”. At its most basic it is the ability to send and receive a private message. The *key* is that you want your recipient and only your recipient to be able to read the message. Therefore, in most cases cryptography is a 2-way street in hiding AND unhiding a communicated message.\n"

    "## What is a cipher?\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is a **cryptographic algorithm** that provides a way to encrypt as well as decrypt data. This allows someone to jumble up some info, send it safely without revealing the content, and have someone at the other end un-jumble it to see the original info.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it’s useless if we can’t control who is able to decrypt the message. Fortunately, there is another input to a cipher – the **key**! This is the small piece of information that is necessary in order to encrypt and decrypt information with a cipher. Some ciphers require other small details as well such as an initialization vector, but we are not going to focus on those for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cryptographic Algorithm** *is just a fancy term for jibberish instructions. It’s what we call the ruleset that is used to take data from one state to another and (most of the time) back.*\n",
